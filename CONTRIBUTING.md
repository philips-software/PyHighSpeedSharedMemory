# Contribution guidelines

## How to contribute

If you want to make a contribution you can fork the repository and create an upstream Pull Request with your proposals.
To prevent build breaks run the same quality checks at your desk run "run_pytest" in 
the test directory and post the resulting xml file as proof. 


## Contribution model

We follow Open Source Software (OSS) model. You can find more details on how it works [here](https://confluence.atlas.philips.com/display/GITHUB/Contribution+Models) and how to raise your PR [here](https://github.com/philips-internal/guidance/blob/main/templates/CONTRIBUTING.MD#oss-model).
